/**
 * The app's database, through Drizzle: one handle every feature's repo queries, opened from where the data lives, so
 * the same queries run on a local SQLite file today and on Turso or D1 later. Only repos (`<feature>/repo.ts`) touch
 * it; handlers never do.
 *   'file:./state.sqlite', a plain path, ':memory:', or an open `DatabaseSync`  → node:sqlite (built in, no native
 *                                                                                 module), through Drizzle's proxy driver
 *   any async Drizzle SQLite database                                           → used as it is: Turso / libSQL
 *                                                                                 `drizzle(createClient({ url, authToken }))`
 *                                                                                 (`drizzle-orm/libsql`), D1 `drizzle(env.DB)`
 * The module imports on Workers: node:sqlite loads only when a path asks for it. Raw `db.all(sql…)` rows are arrays
 * on node:sqlite and objects on D1, so repos read rows through the query builder or name their columns.
 * Each feature brings its tables and its migrations: `migrate(db, 'menus', MENUS_MIGRATIONS)` applies the steps it
 * hasn't yet, in order, and records them in `kit_migrations`. A step never changes once shipped; a change is a new step.
 *
 * @example
 * const db = await openDb(`file:${join(env.STATE_DIR, 'state.sqlite')}`)
 * registerMenus(app, { db, … })                  // migrates its own tables
 * const rows = await db.select().from(notes).where(eq(notes.owner, id))
